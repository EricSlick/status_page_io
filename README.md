# StatusPageIo

This is a wrapper for StatusPage.IO's api.

This is a modified version of https://github.com/richardking/statuspagerb that just implements some additional
capabilities and modifies the coding style to better suit my preferences. You may prefer the other version and
should check it out. This is my first attempt to create a useful gem and besides being a blatant rip-off of Richard
King's work, it's a way for me to learn and hopefully to provide something of use to the Ruby community.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'status_page_io'

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install status_page_io
