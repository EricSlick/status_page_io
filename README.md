# StatusPageIo
[![PullReview stats](https://www.pullreview.com/github/EricSlick/status_page_io/badges/master.svg?)](https://www.pullreview.com/github/EricSlick/status_page_io/reviews/master)
This is a wrapper for StatusPage.IO's api.

This is a modified version of https://github.com/richardking/statuspagerb that just implements some additional
capabilities and modifies the coding style to better suit my preferences. You may find greater value in Richard's
gem and should check it out. This is my first attempt to create a useful gem and besides being a blatant rip-off of
Richard King's work, it's a way for me to learn about creating and maintaining a gem and hopefully provide
something of value (however small) to the Ruby community.

## Installation

Right now, this is just a place to save off my variant of Richard King's main StatusPage class.  I used a trimmed
down version of this class to automate creating an incident when we put a product into unscheduled
maintenance.

You may wish to just copy the main class, StatusPageIo, (just like I did with statuspagerb) and modify
it to suit your needs.  Eventually, it will become a proper gem. I will add tests and some examples
of how you can use it.

If you want to use this as a gem now, you will need to build the gem locally.

    gem build status_page_io.gemspec

Someday though...

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'status_page_io' (not yet available as a gem)

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install status_page_io (not yet available as a gem)

## Usage

Inside the config folder at your project's root add a status_page_io.yml file with the following...

    oauth: <your status page key>
    page: <your page id>
